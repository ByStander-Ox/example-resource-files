        <source>Arriba, Arriba! Andale, Andale! Be fast as Speedy Gonzales. Just hit TAB to save and go to the next text segment, once you're done.</source>

        <source>Houston, we have no problem. Keep track of the progress of your translations by statuses at any time.</source>

        <source>Keep your fingers off the mouse. Master your keyboard: Change the status by using one of the shortcut keys: e.g. CTRL+K = Translated.\n You can see other shortcuts at the bottom of the editor!</source>

        <source>We just like to see you happy, that's why LingoChecks automatically check translations for predetermined criteria.\n Among other checks LingoHub verifies if %1 used in the original text are also present in translated texts.</source>

        <source>Dear developers, you are the masters of translation files. Add comments in a file (depends on file format) to provide translators with more information. They are imported as a description, visible in the side panel.</source>
